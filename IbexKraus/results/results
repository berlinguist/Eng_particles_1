Unfortunately%2C there is no one who can look after the students who can't go%2C so if you don't have permission slips from every student%2C you can't go on the field trip.  Today was the last day for students to turn in their permission slips and you need to tell the other teachers whether you'll be going or not.

Today was the last day for students to turn in their permission slips and you need to tell the other teachers whether you'll be going or not.
